To run the programme use the following command->
perl sort.perl RULEFILE

This programme sort the rules of the transfergrammar engine in a decreasing order based on the number of chunks in the LHS side of the rule i.e the rules are ordered from more specific to general rules.

For a test case run the following->
perl sort.pl test1
1. This will convert the rules in the test1 file in a sorted order and will output the re-ordered rules in the test1-modified file.
2. To run the transfer grammar system with new sorted file use the test1-modified file as the rule file.
   run following commands to replace the old rulefile with the new modified rulefile->	
   a) cp RULEFILE Old_RULEFILE
   b) cp RULEFILE-modified RULEFILE


Specific To General Criteria-
A rule "A" is said to be more specific than rule "B" if all the constraints/conditions satisfied by rule "B" are satisfied by "A" but all the constraints/conditions satisfied by rule "A" are not satusfied by rule "B".
Example
R1: NP~1 NP~2 VGF => NP~1 VGF NP~2
R2: NP~1 NP~2 NP~3 VGF => NP~1 NP~2 VGF NP~3

So rule R2 is more specific than rule R1 since it satisfies more constraints hence the tool(sort.perl) will re-order the rules accordingly as
R2: NP~1 NP~2 NP~3 VGF => NP~1 NP~2 VGF NP~3
R1: NP~1 NP~2 VGF => NP~1 VGF NP~2
